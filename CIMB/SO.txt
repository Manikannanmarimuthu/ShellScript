Since Nov does not have date 31 so program by pass the month 11,9 etc.    Logically, it has no issue. 
That is pretty difficult to capture such problems unless the developer has strong experience and highlight during the development stage. 

We need to inquire from CIMB about few things:
How does SGPS manage it?
Is it possible to handle it manually to allow for more time to understand the requirement?
How many SO record impacted which was scheduled in 31th and Monthly?


Select * from mdpy_bzmas_standing_order where so_type='DD' and frequency_type='Monthly' and recurrence_pattern like  '31 * ? *%' and status = 'status='ACTIVE' order by so_creation_date desc;
Select * from mdpy_bzmas_standing_order where so_type='CT' and frequency_type='Monthly' and recurrence_pattern = '0 0 0 31 * ? *' and  order by so_creation_date desc;

Hi G3 team,

Pls confirm if Outbound Direct Debit triggered for Sep and Nov for this customer.
Customerâ€™s MFT is set on 31st monthly however there is no 31st in the months of Sep and Nov and MFT not triggered on the previous business day.
We have randomly checked other MFTs which are set every 31st monthly and were not triggered as well.
Please advise urgently.
